                <p style="font-size: medium;"> <b style="font-size: large;">2043</b> is an era of complete quantification of lifestyle, with data monitoring and analysis becoming the dominant measure of well-being. Personal health optimisation is an encouraged social pursuit that directly correlates to ones social status and interaction with wider society. Vital Oasis is the most widely used health monitoring technology based on decades of development of healthcare digital devices since 2025. A discreet, bandage-like skin patch embedded with sensors that constantly monitor and analyse the users vitals, including heart rate, glucose level, nervous system and data correlation with daily actions. These results are linked to a software application where users daily schedule and actions are planned and managed in the pursuit of health optimisation. The patch prioritises user emotional stability, productivity and longevity through real-time adjustment of user diets, exercising levels, and social interactions. Restrictions on actions could be activated depending on the users ability to achieve particular standards of vital data, suggesting direct correlation between one's social status and their health statistics. This includes access to affiliated social clubs, restrictions on entertainment apps, and benefits on economic activities. 
                    <br><br>
                In this future, self-care and optimisation are made possible with the development of fitness tracking systems and the quantification of health data. Bodily intuition and autonomy are rendered irrelevant, in which data algorithms hold authority over the standard of a <i>healthy</i> life.

                <p><b>Vital Oasis</b> has gained full support from the government and public health institutions as it aligns with national wellness initiatives and in reducing healthcare costs. It is an advanced technology with investments from tech corporations in biometric data systems. The technology is integrated into tech brands' digital products to build a data ecosystem, which would result in the expansion of their market presence into the health sector. Health Insurance companies have also openly welcomed the technology into their plans, using the data to adjust policies and measure health risks for product costs. It allows companies to predict potential health risks and tailor their plans to customers, which could include increasing coverage and prices.</p>

                <p><b>societal embrace of lifestyle quantification</b><br><br>
                     Beginning in the 2020s, society has been embracing the use of algorithms and data as a source of grounded truth. The pursuit of perfection in health, productivity, and success became a reachable goal under the culture of self-surveillance through tracking quantified wellness acts, such as step counts, sleep patterns, and calorie calculations. The <i>ideal lifestyle</i> is tied to algorithmic feedback and statistics tracking by external devices and apps, leading to a growing dependency on data to make decisions for personal health.
                <br><br><b>Technology development</b><br>
                Health and fitness tracking devices have been increasing in popularity since the 2010s, with tools like Apple Watch and Fitbit introduced into the community with biometric tracking functions. They monitored user heart rate, sleeping patterns and step counts in the form of a detachable smart watch with sensors, conducting analysis and providing trend reports with health advices. These devices inspired the new forms of biometric technology, taking health assistance into a seamless, personalised experience in the form of sensory skin patches. The development of MC10 Biostamp has led to the successful creation of flexible sensory applications in the form of a thin, band-aid-like skin patch which blends into the skin and monitors a wide range of biometric data with cloud AI support. It supports continuous tracking of vital performance with real-time intervention that manages users health with data analysis and wellness modelling. </p>

                <p> <b>Mental Health Conflicts</b><br><br>Constant tracking and interventions build pressure for users to perform in a restricted and <i>ideal</i> manner, which could feed into individual obsession with numbers, fueling extreme self-consciousness and anxiety. User might connect self-worth to the reflection of data, particularly with their loss of intuition and the ability to think critically in terms of personal well-being due to over-reliance on external sources. With over-management of their lifestyle, it erases space for self-trust, rest and flexibility. It could lead to obsessive, abnormal behaviours in the pursuit of <i>perfect</i> health that go against natural bodily practices. While healthcare costs might decrease generally, mental health issues would increase exponentially over time. </p>

                Emotional intimacy and connection could be reduced to statistics, people turning data points into social standards and dialogue cues, which could lead to the loss of empathy, understanding and nuanced feelings. It also builds competition between peers, comparison between productivity rates, performance scores, which could start off as motivation but turn into anxiety of being seen as ‘left behind’. Human relationships would become superficial and strained by subtle statistical rivalry, with solidarity being promoted to those who achieve and stay in its prioritised culture and pace.</p>
